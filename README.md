THE CHALLENGE | TRASH CLEANUP
Oceanic garbage patches are collections of marine debris that come together due to ocean currents; they have devastating effects on ocean ecosystems. Your challenge is to design a mission to help clean up garbage from the ocean!

Our challenge is to design and develop a submarine which will collect plastic garbage. We are using data from NASA sites to keep 7.5 billion people alive and healthy, we are the taking initiatives.

Background:

Oceanic garbage patches are collections of marine debris that come together due to ocean currents; they have devastating effects on ocean ecosystems .
There are over 5 TRILLION pieces of plastic in the ocean, but only 3.5 trillion fish.The oceans cover 72 percent of the Earth and supply half its oxygen which now is in dangerpercent of the Earth and supply half its oxygen which now is in danger.
Our mission is concerned with billions of people and trillions of sea wild lives.

Designed body contains PVC pipe and necessary home tools

Actuator for movement functionalities
Different sensor for reading data from ocean and detect object to collect trash
GPS for indicates location for further activities and position ensuring
Use Radio Frequency RF(2.4Ghz) communication between submarine and control and command station
Subsequently we use other communication system for backup
Submarine also have autonomous system
Camera section work as the eye of design bot

Challenge Faced:

Our challenge is to design a model sub-marine (Robo-Loggerhead) to help clean up garbage from the ocean. Using NASA Earth science data we will determine location where our mission could be most positively effective and help figure out which type of debris to attempt to collect, and how to collect it.

The challenge of cleaning up the plastic garbage spreads across millions of square kilometers and travels in all directions. Covering this area using vessels and nets would take thousands of years and cost billions of dollars to complete. We can send our Robo-Loggerhead to clean our seas.

Letâ€™s try to be safe and sound.
